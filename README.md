### 📌 Featured Projects

#### [AnDri: Anomaly & Drift Co-Detection System (CIKM 2025 Demo, Under Review)](https://github.com/ZeeChee-Guo/AndriDemo)
- Developed an **active learning workflow** for time series anomaly detection, enabling iterative threshold adjustment and validation with minimal user input.
- Achieved a 20% reduction in false positives and a 15% boost in detection accuracy using Tableau for parameter sensitivity analysis.

#### Multi-Domain Image Classifier
- Designed and trained three lightweight VGG-based CNNs (≤8M parameters, ≤10 layers) and fused them into a 15-class classifier, achieving 85%+ accuracy on CIFAR-100.

#### CineSpectra – Online Movie Platform
- Built a high-performance movie retrieval engine with **Elasticsearch**, supporting instant and fuzzy search across 370,000+ records.
- Led Agile team of 4, coordinating sprints and stand-ups for timely delivery.

#### Distributed File Storage System
- Implemented a distributed file storage system in Java using **JPaxos**, with cluster deployment on Kubernetes for auto-failover and recovery.

#### AI-Powered NFT Generator @ NUS
- Integrated open-source GANs and trained custom models for NFT image style transfer and colorization.
- Deployed a full-stack NFT minting platform using IPFS, Ethereum smart contracts, MetaMask, and AWS, supporting 1,000+ concurrent users.
- 🏅 *Best Innovation Award, NUS Cloud Computing Workshop*

#### Monte Carlo Simulation for Soccer Analytics (INRS, Mitacs Intern)
- Designed Monte Carlo models to output probability distributions for soccer match outcomes, improving forecast reliability for risk-based decision-making.
- Automated EPL data pipeline using Selenium and BeautifulSoup (from 1 hour/week to under 5 minutes/day).
